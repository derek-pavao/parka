# Parka [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dotDeeka/parka.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dotDeeka/parka)

Just as a warning Parka is in a total Pre-Alpha stage, it is not feature complete let alone production
ready.

An example API with Parka will be available at [https://github.com/dotDeeka/parka-todos](https://github.com/dotDeeka/parka-todos)

I suspect that this project will only work with node version 4.x or higher although I haven't tested that

Parka is a simple TypeScript framework/library that runs on Express/NodeJS for building REST services.
Parka takes advantage of TypeScript features like decorators to make things like defining
routes easier.
